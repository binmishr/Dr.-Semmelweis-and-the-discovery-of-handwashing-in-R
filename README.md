# Dr. Semmelweis and the discovery of handwashing

Project Description 
==================== 
In 1847 the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this R project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes you can manipulate data frames using dplyr and make simple plots using R package ggplot2. You can learn these skills in the R package Tidyverse.
